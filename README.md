# FizzBuzz
## What is this project?
This project prints out every number between 1-100. if the
number is divisble by 3, it prints out Fizz instead of the number. If the number is divisble by 5, it prints out Buzz instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints out FizzBuzz. It does this by checking if n%3 or n%5 is equal to zero. This means that the number n is indeed divisble, and it not, we sill simply print out the current count.
